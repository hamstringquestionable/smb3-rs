//! Baseline for overworld output.
//!
//! A committed hash, per seed, of the bytes that describe the map a player
//! walks — terrain, where each tile leads, the sprites standing on it, where
//! pipes come out, and which fortress opens which lock. See
//! [`overworld_fingerprint`] for exactly what is covered and why.
//!
//! It moves for a real topology change, and for an RNG-stream shift from a new
//! draw anywhere upstream — because that genuinely re-deals every seed's map.
//! It does not move for a version bump, a new king quote, a relocated title
//! routine, or an always-on splice, all of which used to force a recapture back
//! when this hashed the whole ROM.
//!
//! **Whole-ROM byte identity is a different question and lives in
//! `tests/rom_identity.rs`** — capture on one tree, compare on another, no
//! committed constant to go stale. Reach for that one when the claim is "this
//! refactor changes nothing at all."
//!
//! Palette randomization is outside the fingerprint's regions, so the
//! not-seed-stable palette bytes cannot make this flap. The sweep still runs
//! with palettes off, so the two harnesses generate the same ROMs.
//!
//! Skipped when the ROM is absent, like the other ROM-dependent tests — the ROM
//! is gitignored and CI has no copy.
