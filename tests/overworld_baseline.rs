//! Byte-identity baseline for overworld output.
//!
//! Guards refactors that are supposed to change nothing — the tile-predicate
//! consolidation in `rom_data::tiles` being the motivating case. Each migration
//! of a call site onto a shared predicate must leave these hashes untouched; a
//! changed hash means the substituted predicate covers a different set than the
//! inlined list it replaced, which is exactly the kind of silent behaviour
//! change a "pure refactor" is not allowed to make.
//!
//! Palette randomization is excluded: it is not seed-stable (two runs of the
//! same seed differ in a handful of NES palette bytes), so it would make this
//! harness flap for reasons unrelated to what it is guarding. Topology is
//! unaffected.
//!
//! Skipped when the ROM is absent, like the other ROM-dependent tests — the
//! ROM is gitignored and CI has no copy.

/// into every ROM (`stomp_fairness::apply`). These hashes cover the whole
/// output, so all 20 seeds moved. Overworld topology is untouched by that
/// change — the ROM bytes differ, the maps do not.
///
/// Re-captured again 2026-08-05 for the Wild Injections sun/lakitu pool
/// (`FLAG_KEY_VERSION` 27 → 28). The version byte is stamped into every ROM,
/// so all 20 seeds moved for that reason alone: pinning the constant back to
/// 27 reproduced the previous hashes exactly, which is the check that this
/// regeneration hides no real change. Default options leave the injection
/// mode Off, so no gameplay byte differs.
///
/// Re-captured again 2026-08-09 for the wider title-hash icon set: ICON_TILES
/// grew from 15 to 20 rows and the palette digit was dropped, so the 40-byte
/// sprite table at `FS_SEED_HASH_DATA` differs for every seed and all 20 moved.
/// Verified the same way as the v29 recapture — seeds 1-3 generated before and
/// after with `--no-palettes` (the player wardrobe is not seed-deterministic)
/// and diffed byte by byte. Every difference lands inside FS_SEED_HASH_DATA; no
/// overworld, level or enemy byte moved.
///
/// Re-captured again 2026-08-06 for the v29 flag-key re-layout (issue #158).
/// Same story, verified the same way but end-to-end rather than by pinning a
/// constant, since the whole format changed: seeds 1-3 were generated before
/// and after and diffed byte by byte. Every difference lands in one of the two
/// places that carry the flag bytes on purpose — the stamp block at 0x19DF0 and
/// the title-screen verification icons at `FS_SEED_HASH_DATA` (0x3E93D), whose
/// hash folds `to_flag_bytes()`. No overworld, level, or enemy byte moved.
/// Re-captured 2026-08-17 for the treasure-box room rules, backported from
/// beta/next (PR #179). Two changes, both deliberate:
///
/// 1. A `$81` in a `Level_Event = 7` room that is not a real bro battle is
///    rewritten by `ObjInit_HammerBro` into an unkillable object, so it is now
///    excluded from every such room (`rewrites_hammer_bro`).
/// 2. Those rooms are cleared to be left, so they take the bro-fight pool: the
///    8-Tank treasure room joins the Coin Ship as a `HammerBro` segment, and
///    Dry Bones moved from `STOMPABLE_ENEMIES` to `HB_NEEDS_SHELL_ENEMIES` (it
///    is stompable but revives, so only a kicked shell clears it).
///
/// All 20 seeds move, attributed rather than assumed. Diffing every seed
/// against the previous build at default flags: 132 enemy IDs differ, and the
/// only one in a treasure-box room is `0x0DA3A` (the 8-Tank slot) in 13 of 20
/// seeds — always landing on vanilla `$82`. That is the whole story: with
/// `hb_encounters` Off, `hb_modes` is all-Off, so routing that room through the
/// HB path means its single entry no longer draws where the old `ForceTankBro`
/// row drew once. One fewer draw per seed, and every downstream consumer moves.
/// The pool changes themselves only bite with `hb_encounters` on, which this
/// sweep does not exercise — `treasure_box_rooms_never_get_a_hammer_bro` and the
/// shell-pairing invariant in `enemies::tests` cover that instead.
