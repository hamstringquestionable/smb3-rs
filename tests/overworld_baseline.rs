//! Byte-identity baseline for overworld output.
//!
//! Guards refactors that are supposed to change nothing — the tile-predicate
//! consolidation in `rom_data::tiles` being the motivating case. Each migration
//! of a call site onto a shared predicate must leave these hashes untouched; a
//! changed hash means the substituted predicate covers a different set than the
//! inlined list it replaced, which is exactly the kind of silent behaviour
//! change a "pure refactor" is not allowed to make.
//!
//! Palette randomization is excluded: it is not seed-stable (two runs of the
//! same seed differ in a handful of NES palette bytes), so it would make this
//! harness flap for reasons unrelated to what it is guarding. Topology is
//! unaffected.
//!
//! Skipped when the ROM is absent, like the other ROM-dependent tests — the
//! ROM is gitignored and CI has no copy.
